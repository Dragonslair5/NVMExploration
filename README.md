# Master's degree artifacts

In this repository there are artifacts from the master's degree dissertation from Maur√≠cio Gagliardi Palma, that takes the following title:

__Simulation-driven exploration of NVM as a substitute for DRAM in the main memory__

Currently there are only the benchmarks that were used. I intent to put the pdf from the dissertation here as soon as the final version is over (after the defense and potential corrections).

Unfortunatelly, the code from the simulator and the NVMalloc API are currently not opened yet. As soon as we open the source code, I will put a link here to the simulator's repository.

===========================================

As there is a submodule in this repository (from the ART Tree source code), you may want to use the following commands to clone this repository:
